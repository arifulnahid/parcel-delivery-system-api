# Parcel Delivery System API

A comprehensive RESTful API for managing parcel delivery operations, built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB. This system handles user management, parcel tracking, payment processing, and role-based access control for a complete delivery management solution.

## üìã Project Overview
